                        The Bible is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Tanakh and the Greek Septuagint. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of narratives, letters, and apocalyptic writings.

                        Pastor Jim Cymbala calls us back to a fiery, passionate preoccupation with God that will restore what the enemy has stolen from us: our first love for Jesus, our zeal, our troubled children, our wounded marriages, our broken and divided churches. Born out of the heart and soul of Brooklyn Tabernacle, the message of Fresh Faith is illustrated by true stories of men and women whose lives have been changed through the power of faith.

                        This Bible study is based on seven Scriptural realities that teach us how to develop a true relationship with the Creator. By understanding how God is working through us, and around us, and seeking to better understand his ways, we can begin to more clearly know and do His will. As we experience this we begin to see our lives greatly and gracefully change.
