                        <p>40 years ago, Don Haskins went on the recruiting trail to find the best talent in the land, black or white. 7 blacks and 5 whites made up the legendary 1965-66 Texas Western Miners. They were mocked and ridiculed for their showboating and flaunting of black players on the court. Yet, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, Haskins and his Miners came together as a team united to reach the National Championship game against Kentucky.</p>

                        <p>Smokey Banks used to be one of the greatest bull riders in rodeo. For the last few years this has-been cowboy has been riding the bottle more, and taking a far worse beating than any bull ever delivered. Through a strange and sudden set of events, he is given an option : go to jail, or be a cowboy teacher at a Boy's Ranch. His mission was simple: teach young Danny how to ride a bull. Danny becomes far more of a teacher to him than he ever dreamed.</p>

Against the advice of her doctors, Marion followed one of those cards to America for Craig's miraculous cure.</p>
