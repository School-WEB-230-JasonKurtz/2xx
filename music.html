                    <div class="cardInfoText">
                        <p>This song was written by songwriter and producer Charlie Peacock. Peacock told CCM Magazine that this testament to the struggle between who we are and who we want to be was inspired by African music. He explained: "Musically, I started out with a groove inspired by Johnny Clegg and Savuka, a South African Zulu pop Group. I wanted it to be very singable and simple." DC Talk covered this on their 1995 Jesus Freak album.</p>

                    <div class="cardInfoText">
                        <p>"What If I Stumble?" is a song by the American contemporary Christian music group DC Talk. Released in 1995, on the group's fourth album, Jesus Freak. The song features a vocal quote from Brennan Manning. "The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today are Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips and then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."</p>

                    <div class="cardInfoText">
                        <p>The super catchy "Underdog" follows, a sort-of theme song for Christians who feel like they themselves are underdogs and alone in the world. The title Underdog comes from the belief that Christians are usually seen as "underdogs" or "weak...but we're not. We're just the opposite. God's empowered us because we've become less for Him," says Herdman.</p>

                        <p>When Daigle wrote the song with Michael Farren, she was going through a time of significant loss. She explained: "My grandfather had just passed away and he and I were super close. When I lived in Baton Rouge and went to LSU, I lived with him. He was so much fun and one of the most influential men in my life. He was the first person really close to me that I had lost." It's about trusting that the Lord is going to be there for you."</p>

                        <p>The picture that Mac Powell paints here of the promises we make to people we love. How we say we'll do anything for them and that we often dom't, or are not capable of, those things we promise we'll do. Then the song shows how Jesus did those things, how he gave everything. He payed the highest price and gave his life for us because He loves us.</p>
