The videos range in style from interviews with experts, such as 2011 Physics Nobel Laureate Brian Schmidt, to science experiments, dramatisations, songs, and—a hallmark of the channel—interviews with the public to uncover misconceptions about science. As of 3 June 2017 the main channel has 228 uploads, 4,190,804 subscribers and 355,612,243 total views. I am one of those said subscribers.

Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.
